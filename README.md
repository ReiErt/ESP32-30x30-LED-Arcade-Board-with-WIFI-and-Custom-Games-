# ESP32 30x30 LED Arcade Board with WIFI and Custom Games

Task: Wire 30 strips of 30 LEDs in series connected to a ESP32 Microcontroller at a single port. Create startup menu to select between 3 different games.
The games should be multiplayer with connection via Wifi.

My focus is on the PHY --> Controlling the LEDs. Ensuring the Microcontroller can update the LEDs fast enough to create a real gaming experience.
Find a realiable method for lighting the LED strip, while meeting timing closure.
